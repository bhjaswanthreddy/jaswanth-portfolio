# 🚀 Jaswanth's "Command Line to Cosmos" Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive developer portfolio – a creative blend of **terminal nostalgia** and **cosmic exploration**. This is not your average portfolio. It's designed to reflect my journey from writing code in the terminal to building projects that reach for the stars ✨

---

## ✅ Week 1 Progress: Foundation & CLI Experience

### 🧱 Stack Setup

- Initialized the project using **Next.js (App Router)** with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Installed and configured `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for lightweight 3D rendering

### 💻 Command-Line Homepage

- Built a terminal-style landing screen that types out:
  jaswanth@portfolio:~$ show portfolio

- Simulated typing animation with a blinking cursor
- Triggered a transition into the **3D galaxy view** once the command executes

### 🌌 Cosmic Canvas Setup

- Integrated a minimal **3D starfield** using `Stars` from `drei`
- Set up orbit controls and ambient light for a smooth visual space

### 👨‍🎓 About Section (Data-Driven)

- Created a `data/about.json` file to store resume-based details
- Built an `AboutMe.tsx` component to render my name, tagline, education, and contact links
- Displayed the About card over the cosmic view as a floating modal (for now)

---

## 🔭 Week 2 & Beyond: What’s Next?

### 🌠 Constellation-Based Navigation

- Replace modal with **interactive star nodes** representing Projects, Skills, About
- Click on a star → fade-in a glowing info modal

### 📦 Dynamic Data Loaders

- `projects.json`: Details like Fault Diagnosis, Lab Equipment Tracker
- `skills.json`: Show orbiting skill icons or badges with categories

### 🧠 Features in Pipeline

- AI Easter Egg: A secret CLI command to launch "JasBot"
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion or Drei transitions
- Cosmic background interactions on scroll or cursor
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet experience
- Deployment via **Vercel** with custom domain

---

## 💡 Why This Format?

As someone passionate about both **engineering** and **user experience**, I wanted this portfolio to feel like a journey—not just a static page. From my roots in C++ and Python to real-world ML applications and cloud deployments, this design embodies both the logic and creativity of my path.
